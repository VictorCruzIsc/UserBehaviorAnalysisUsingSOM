=== Abstract ===
Abstract - This works presents a novel implementation for Kohonen Self
Organizing Feature Maps (SOM) suitable for user behavior analysis in Campus Area
Networks (CAN). SOM algorithm works under competitive and unsupervised learning
approach, making it perfect for clustering and feature selection tasks. SOM is
used to create behavior clusters through the analysis of user network traffic,
in fixed time intervals. To demostrate the feasibility of SOM, resulting users
clusters are merged and evaluated against new complex network traffic dataset.
Experimental results, show that an user can be identified based in it's network
traffic since it generates a match in a previous created cluster.
